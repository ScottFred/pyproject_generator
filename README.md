## Quick Start Guide

### Configure envfile
1. Open the envfile
    1. Enter your name in the author argument
        ```bash
        export AUTHOR="Timothy Helton"
        ```
    1. Enter your email address in the email argument
        ```bash
        export EMAIL="timothy.helton@greymattersdefense.com"
        ```

### Execution
The script has a single required argument, which is the name of the package.
```bash
./new_pyproject.sh example_package
```
A new repository will be generated in the current directory and initialized
with Git version control.

### Update the Docker Configuration
The base script creates the minimum number of objects to define Python and
NGINX containers.
This is done to allow the automation of initializing the Sphinx documentation.
Once the script has been executed, modify the `if __name__ = 'main':` section
of `scripts/docker_config.py` to add additional desired services.
The following example would add a MongoDB container and configure the Python
container to utilize a GPU.

```bash
if __name__ == '__main__':
    config = ComposeConfiguration()
    services = (
        ComposeService.MONGO,
    )
    for s in services:
        config.add_service(s)
    config.add_gpu()
    config.write()
```

### Rebuild the Docker Environment
Once the `scrips/docker_config.py` file has been modified to the your liking
call the following make target to update the Docker environment.
This will:
- update the `docker/docker-compose.yaml` file
- rebuild the Docker environment

```bash
make docker-update-config
```
